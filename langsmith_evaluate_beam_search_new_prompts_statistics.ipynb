However, the term \"process intensification\" itself was first coined in the 1980s.\\n\\nOne of the earliest examples of process intensification can be attributed to the work of Nobel laureate Fritz Haber in the early 20th century. Haber developed the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis, which is a prime example of process intensification. The Haber-Bosch process involves the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen at high temperatures and pressures to produce ammonia. This process was a significant innovation at the time, as it allowed for the large-scale production of ammonia, which is a critical component in the production of fertilizers.\\n\\nAnother early example of process intensification can be seen in the development of the catalytic reforming process for the production of high-octane gasoline. This process, which was developed in the 1940s and 1950s, involves the use of a catalyst to convert low-octane naphtha into high-octane gasoline. The catalytic reforming process is a classic example of process intensification, as it allows for the production of a high-value product from a low-value feedstock.\\n\\nThe term \"process intensification\" itself was first coined in the 1980s by researchers at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. The concept of process intensification was further developed in the 1990s and 2000s, with the establishment of the Process Intensification Network (PIN) and the publication of several books and papers on the subject.\\n\\nOverall, while the concept of process intensification has its roots in the early 20th century, the term itself was first coined in the 1980s, and the field has continued to evolve and grow since then.'}, reference_example_id=UUID('788322b9-30d4-4701-9b12-8d01759e01cc'), parent_run_id=None, tags=[], parent_run=None, child_runs=[], session_name='openai/gpt-4o-mini_judge_with_meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct_resample_0-83f8d107', session_id=None, client=Client (API URL: https://api.smith.langchain.com), dotted_order='20241129T145239892541Z04073482-031f-46c5-a7d9-bfae1de9d481', trace_id=UUID('04073482-031f-46c5-a7d9-bfae1de9d481')), 'example': Example(dataset_id=UUID('d47423d8-85ac-40f5-938e-592819891332'), inputs={'question': 'What was the first appearance of process intensification in chemical engineering?'}, outputs={'answer': 'The first appearance fo process intensification as we know it today was marked by the paper on application of centrifugal fields, or so called \"HiGee\".
