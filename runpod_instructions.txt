#The following files should be copied to '/workspace' in the the pod:
1)Example_QA_data_raw.xlsx
2)env #API keys 
3)requirements.txt

#https://docs.runpod.io/pods/configuration/use-ssh
#The first time we do that process we should use:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "soyrlos@gmail.com"
#and then navigate to the folder 'C:\Users\soyrl/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub'
#and add the key to https://www.runpod.io/console/user/settings

#https://docs.runpod.io/pods/storage/transfer-files
#Copy the above files to the Pod with the following command (change port and paths based on the running pod):
scp -P 43201 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 /Users/nikolaossourlo/Desktop/fine_tune_files/requirements.txt root@194.26.196.6:/workspace/requirements.txt

#Initiaze Pod and connect to it with the command in Runpod: 'SSH over exposed TCP: (Supports SCP & SFTP)'
ssh root@78.130.201.2 -p 20187 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

#To maintain pip installs after we stop the pod we need a virtual environment. 
#Create new virtual environment inside the pod in the 'workspace' folder (so that it's there after we stop the pod) with:
python -m venv /workspace/myenv
source /workspace/myenv/bin/activate
cd /workspace

#Inside the venv install the following:
pip install --upgrade ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --name myenv --user --display-name "Python (myenv)"
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install flash-attn==2.6.3

#To download the created xlsx and the png graphs from the server use:
scp -P 13737 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@213.144.200.206:/workspace/*.{xlsx,png} Users/nikolaossourlo/Desktop/test/

#Open a jupyter notebook locally with VScode and 'select kernel'=> 'existing jupyter servers' and paste the link of the jupyter port in it. 
#The link will look like: https://63pub3gafh3voc-8888.proxy.runpod.net/?token=lzqgqxha88cglhg992ld
#To see remaining capacity of pod use 'df -h'
#We cannot create a permanent network volume in community cloud (only in secure one): https://docs.runpod.io/pods/storage/create-network-volumes?ref=blog.runpod.io
#If we stop the pod, a bit later resources will probably not be available, as stated in https://docs.runpod.io/references/faq#why-do-i-have-zero-gpus-assigned-to-my-pod. Therefore, it's suggested to terminate it (to also save credits).
