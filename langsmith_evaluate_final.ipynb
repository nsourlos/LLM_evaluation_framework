This limitation becomes particularly important in the case of large molecules, such as proteins. In membrane chromatography, dissolved molecules are carried by the forced convective ﬂow through the membrane pores, where the ﬁlm diﬀusion (much faster than the pore diﬀusion) leads them to functional ligands attached to the inner pore structure, which act as adsorbents. This way, the process throughput can be signiﬁcantly increased.'), ('What is the function of a membrane in the emulsion-free enzymatic splitting of fats?', 'The function of the membrane in the case of emulsion-free enzymatic splitting of fats is nondispersive phase contacting, with reaction at the phase interface or in the bulk phases.'), ('Which other separation methods could overlap with distillation?', 'Methods that can synergize with distillation are: Extraction, Distillation and Membranes.

It could be used for an incidental improvement of one or another process step or equipment, but it lacked the generic dimension, which is needed for a multiscale, holistic process design and development.

This limitation becomes particularly important in the case of large molecules, such as proteins. In membrane chromatography, dissolved molecules are carried by the forced convective ﬂow through the membrane pores, where the ﬁlm diﬀusion (much faster than the pore diﬀusion) leads them to functional ligands attached to the inner pore structure, which act as adsorbents.
