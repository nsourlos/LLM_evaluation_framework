This limitation becomes particularly important in the case of large molecules, such as proteins. In membrane chromatography, dissolved molecules are carried by the forced convective ﬂow through the membrane pores, where the ﬁlm diﬀusion (much faster than the pore diﬀusion) leads them to functional ligands attached to the inner pore structure, which act as adsorbents. This way, the process throughput can be signiﬁcantly increased.'), ('What is the function of a membrane in the emulsion-free enzymatic splitting of fats?', 'The function of the membrane in the case of emulsion-free enzymatic splitting of fats is nondispersive phase contacting, with reaction at the phase interface or in the bulk phases.'), ('Which other separation methods could overlap with distillation?', 'Methods that can synergize with distillation are: Extraction, Distillation and Membranes.

It could be used for an incidental improvement of one or another process step or equipment, but it lacked the generic dimension, which is needed for a multiscale, holistic process design and development.

            "\n",
            "* **Emulsion-free:** This process implies that fats are not emulsified, meaning they are not broken down into tiny droplets dispersed in water. Emulsification is typically necessary for efficient enzymatic breakdown of fats because it increases the surface area available for the enzyme to act upon.\n",
            "* **Enzymatic splitting:** This refers to the process of breaking down fats (triglycerides) into smaller molecules like fatty acids and glycerol using enzymes called lipases.\n",
            "\n",
            "**However, membranes can play a supporting role in this process:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Encapsulation:** Lipases can be encapsulated within membranes, creating microcompartments that concentrate the enzyme and substrate. This can enhance the efficiency of the reaction.\n",
            "* **Selective permeability:** Membranes can be designed to be selectively permeable, allowing substrates to enter while preventing the products from escaping. This can improve the yield of the reaction.\n",
            "\n",
            "**In summary:** While membranes are not essential for the enzymatic splitting of fats in an emulsion-free system, they can be used to improve the efficiency and yield of the process.\n",

            "* **Recycle of Reactants:** Membranes can be used to selectively permeate and recycle unreacted reactants back into the reactor, enhancing conversion and reducing raw material consumption.\n",

            "* **Concentration Gradients:** Membranes can establish concentration gradients across their surfaces, driving reactions towards desired products.\n",
            "* **Microreactor Technology:** Membranes can be integrated into microreactors to create highly efficient and controlled reaction environments.\n",

            "**Process Intensification:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Reduced Reactor Size:** Membranes can enable smaller reactor volumes due to enhanced mass transfer and reaction rates.\n",
            "* **Increased Productivity:** Membranes can improve reaction efficiency and throughput, leading to higher productivity.\n",
