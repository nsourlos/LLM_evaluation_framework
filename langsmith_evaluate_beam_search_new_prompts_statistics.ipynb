The concept of process intensification can be traced back to the 1970s, although its principles have been applied in various forms even earlier.\n",

            "One of the earliest significant examples of process intensification is the development of the \"microreactor\" technology in the late 20th century. Microreactors are small-scale reactors that allow for enhanced mass and heat transfer, leading to improved reaction rates and safety. This technology exemplifies the principles of PI by enabling reactions to occur under more controlled conditions and with greater efficiency.\n",
